# Ticket Machine - Python project 

#### This System asks you what activity you've come to complete and gives you a turn number based on the activity you chose.
#### It is designed for a drugstore that focuses on perfumery, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.
#### The program will ask the consumer which of the places they wish to visit, and depending on the area they choose, 
#### it will assign them a relevant turn number.

#### For example:If you select cosmetics, it will return the letter C (as in cosmetics), - (hyphen) 54. Following that, 
#### it will ask us if we want to take another number to simulate the arrival of a new client, and the process will be repeated.

### Note! The system ask you id number to get the service, so use one of those id numbers. 
### id = ['123456', '456789']
