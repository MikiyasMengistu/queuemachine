# Ticket Machine - Python project

This System asks you what activity you've come to complete and gives you a turn number based on the activity you chose.
It is designed for a drugstore that focuses on perfumery, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.
The program will ask the consumer which of the places they wish to visit, and depending on the area they choose, 
it will assign them a relevant turn number.

For example:If you select cosmetics, it will return the letter C (as in cosmetics), - (hyphen) 54. Following that, 
it will ask us if we want to take another number to simulate the arrival of a new client, and the process will be repeated.

**Note!** The system ask you id number to get the service, so use one of those id numbers. 

**id** = ['123456', '456789']
